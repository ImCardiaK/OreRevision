_**Secondary information:**_
-------------
To modify the values of the script, you must change only the following the ":" (the colon)

_example:_
"ChanceQuartzOre1: 100%"

must remain as it is! except that the "100%" can be changed because it is after the colon.
this is exactly the same for what is in the "options" section of the skript file !


----
To modify the item that will be dropped by the ore, you must write the name of the item or block in question in lowercase and without spelling mistakes!

_example:_
- "DropOfQuartzOre1: quartz"

you can replace "quartz" by other item !

- "DropOfQuartzOre1: stick"

or

- "DropOfQuartzOre1: diamond"
